Explanation of Rankings

The function first tries to find an exact match using all provided criteria.


If no exact match is found, the mileage criteria are relaxed by broadening the range (allowing cars with mileage slightly higher or lower than specified).

If no exact matches are found after relaxing the mileage, the function then looks for cars that match the make and model but with any mileage or year.


If no specific cars match even after relaxing the criteria, the function falls back to providing a very generic estimate based on the average price of all cars of the same make or model, as a last resort.

How the Rankings Were Created:
The rankings were created based on a composite score that evaluates a car's overall desirability by considering several key factors:

1.
Higher fuel economy is generally better, so it positively impacts the score.
Engine Size (engine(cc)):
2.
Larger engines typically provide more power but may be less fuel-efficient. This factor was included in a way that balances power with efficiency, usually subtracting from the score to reflect higher fuel consumption.
Horsepower (horsepower):
3.
More horsepower generally indicates better performance, so it positively impacts the score.

4.
Higher torque contributes to better acceleration and overall performance, positively impacting the score.
Mileage (mileage):

5.
Higher mileage usually means more wear and tear on the vehicle, so it negatively impacts the score.
Price (price):

6.
A lower price might be more attractive, but extremely low prices could indicate poor quality. The price was factored in to ensure a balance between affordability and value.
Year Made (year_made):

7.
Newer cars generally offer better technology and features, so a newer year positively impacts the score.
Ownership (ownership):

8.
The fewer the number of previous owners, the better. More owners usually imply a more complex history, so this negatively impacts the score.
What the Rankings Mean:
Higher Scores:

9.
A higher score indicates that the car is likely more desirable overall. It suggests better fuel efficiency, higher performance (more horsepower and torque), newer manufacturing, fewer previous owners, and an optimal balance of price and mileage.
Lower Scores:

10.
A lower score suggests that the car may have some drawbacks, such as higher mileage, a larger engine that consumes more fuel, an older model year, or more previous owners. These factors might make the car less attractive compared to others with higher scores.
Purpose of the Rankings:
The rankings are designed to help users compare different cars in a more objective way, taking into account multiple aspects of a car's performance, efficiency, age, and ownership history.

Summary:
High scores indicates a well-balanced car with desirable attributes like good fuel economy, strong performance, modern technology, and a clean ownership history. Low scores suggests potential downsides such as higher wear and tear, older technology, or a more complicated ownership history.The rankings can be used to make more informed decisions when selecting a vehicle, ensuring that users consider all critical aspects that contribute to a car's overall value and desirability.
